# BTVTrafficStopData


Data set from https://data.burlingtonvt.gov/datasets/burlingtonvt::traffic-stops/explore.

Final Project for Basics of Data Science taught by Jacob Martin.
Zachary Moss and Therese Ritter

We examined data from burlingtonvt.gov that recorded traffic stops from 2016 to 2023. We compared different factors like time, race, age, and gender against stop type and outcome. Look at our knitted pdf to see the graphs, data, and code.
